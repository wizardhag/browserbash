# browserbash
An html remote terminal for a linux server. It will not be complete, it will only be partially functional.
This just popped into my head while in class, so I'm creating a repository for it now and will look into whether is feasible(from a security standpoint) or logical (from a "is there any actual reason to make this" standpoint). 
If it's feasable for this to be relatively secure but I decide there's no good reason for it, I just might make it anyways for fun.
