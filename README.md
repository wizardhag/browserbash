# browserbash
My original idea for this project was to make an in-browser ssh client with html and javascript, but after a short amount of research I realised any sort of cryptography implemented with javascript is incredibly insecure, so I'm not going to do that. I still wanted to make a terminal look-alike for fun though, so I made this. It has command history using the up/down arrow keys,  it pretends to change directories using cd, and if you end a line with '\' it will accept the next line as part of the same command. Other than that this is totally useless, but I left it on here because I thought the pretend terminal was fun.
